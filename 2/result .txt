### Structured Bug Report


**Input Analysis:**
- **Core functionality affected**: Session termination (logout)
- **Observed failure**: No response to click interaction
- **Platform/device clues**: Safari browser (specific version/OS not provided)
- **Missing details**: Reproduction steps, exact Safari version, OS, device type, frequency

**Title**: Logout Button Unresponsive in Safari Browser


**Description**:
The logout button fails to respond to user clicks in Safari browsers, preventing session termination. This blocks users from securely exiting the application, posing account security risks and workflow disruption.


**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Launch application in Safari browser
2. Authenticate with valid credentials
3. Navigate to any page containing the logout button
4. Click the logout button
*Note: Assumed core workflow based on report*


**Expected vs Actual**:
-  ✅  **Expected**: Button click terminates session and redirects to login page
-  ❌  **Actual**: No observable response (no loading state, error, or redirect)


**Environment**:
- OS: Unknown (recommend testing macOS/iOS)
- Browser/Device: Safari (version unspecified) / Device type unconfirmed
- App Version: Requires validation


**Severity**: **High**
*Rationale: Blocks security-critical functionality (session termination), creating unauthorized access risks.*

### Key Rationale
1. **Severity justification**:
- Directly impacts security compliance (session management)
- Prevents core user action (logout)
- Risk rating aligns with OWASP A2: Broken Authentication criteria


2. **Assumption handling**:
- Generic reproduction steps marked with disclaimer
- Explicit "requires validation" tags for missing environment details


3. **Impact framing**:
- Connects technical failure ("no response") to security/user consequences
- Uses actionable terminology ("blocks", "prevents", "posing risks")


4. **Reproducibility optimization**:
- Clear step sequence isolates variables (browser > auth > interaction)
- Implicitly guides developer to test:
- Safari event listeners
- Session destruction API calls
- Browser console errors


*Recommendation: Prioritize validation on Safari 16+ (macOS Ventura/iOS 16) as most common enterprise baseline.*
